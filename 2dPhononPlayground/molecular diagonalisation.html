<!--Need to reshape the 2d_band_gap code to make introduction in molecular vibrations

I need to show how to do diagonalisation - matrix, vector times matrix, diagonalisation by hand
diagonalisation by finding the highest mode

orthogonalisation

mention that our problem is hermitian, thus there will always be solutions with orthogonal 

then when I find all of them, stack the matrix between them and suddenly baaaam, it is diagonalised

Slides on what diagonalisation is all about


Quiz - find all modes, Check how Mark's stuff fits into (hint: different symmetries )



Would be cool to have symmetries on vectors. It is a bit trickier for 6 fold rotation.

Make a couple of molecules

Make a molecule constructor - show how you add atoms, how you add forces (angles and springs, how matrix changes - highlight with orange plus explicitly show the contribution in the matrix)



Do the same stuff for periodic crystals, show how dynamic matrix changes for different k points, plot graphs

construct crystals


show strobe?


Show vibrations
Play sounds

Make a web site: how does a molecule ring. Get somewhere a long list of molecules, optimise their orientation with some DFT, calculate frequencies, show them in 3d, play the sound.
