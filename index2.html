            <p>Hi, I am Arkadiy. Currently I work as a research fellow in the University of Oxford at <a href="https://goodwingroup.wordpress.com/">Andrew Goodwin group</a>.</p>
            
            My research is focused in understanding the structure and function of disordered single crystals. I am developing a novel method for analysing diffuse scattering from single crystals called the three dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D-ΔPDF).

It is shown that by controlling the local order it is possible to broaden specific dispersion bands. In the current example, the lowest acoustic bands are selectively distorted. In real materials such techniques can be used to produce better thermoelectric meterials. [...]

              <p class="abstract">Functional materials design normally focuses on structurally ordered systems because disorder is considered detrimental to many functional properties. Here we challenge this paradigm by showing that particular types of strongly correlated disorder can give rise to useful characteristics that are inaccessible to ordered states. A judicious combination of low-symmetry building unit and high-symmetry topological template leads to aperiodic ‘procrystalline’ solids that harbour this type of disorder. We identify key classes of procrys- talline states together with their characteristic diffraction behaviour, and establish mappings onto known and target materials. The strongly correlated disorder found in these systems is associated with specific sets of modulation periodicities distributed throughout the Brillouin zone. Lattice dynamical calculations reveal selective disorder-driven phonon broadening that resembles the poorly understood ‘waterfall’ effect observed in relaxor ferroelectrics. This property of procrystalline solids suggests a mechanism by which strongly correlated topo- logical disorder might allow independently optimized thermal and electronic transport behaviour, such as required for high-performance thermoelectrics.</p>

The diffraction pattern shows diffuse streaks interconnecting Bragg reflections along all cubic〈111〉directions. These streaks exhibit satellite-like maxima and arise from vacancy ordering in non-periodically spaced defect layers. The atom layers near these vacancy layers are displaced with respect to the average structure: they tend to form α􏰓-GeTe-type double layers. The three- dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D-􏰅ΔPDF) method yields quantitative information on the distribution of defect layer spacings, which peaks at a value corresponding to Ge<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> building blocks. The cation distribution along with the displacement of the atom layers is refined as well, using a least-squares approach. Bi concentrates on cation positions next to the vacancy layers.</p>

                  The structure of <i>hP</i>386-Al<sub>57.4</sub>Cu<sub>3.6</sub>Ta<sub>39.0</sub> was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. It can be described as a hexagonal close-packing of two types of endohedral fullerene-like clusters with different Frank-Kasper polyhedra filling the gaps. The description of the structure as a superstructure and as a layered structure illustrates other characteristic structural building principles. The diffuse scattering, which can be observed in some of the crystals, is qualitatively well reproduced by a disorder model. A comparison with the structures of the other complex intermetallics in the system Al-Cu-Ta indicates the decisive role that Cu plays in the constitution and packing of the clusters.

              <p class="abstract">Diffuse scattering from a substitutionally disordered tris-tert-butyl-1,3,5-benzene tricarboxamide single crystal is analyzed with the three-dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D-ΔPDF) method. The real structure of the crystal is shown to consist of infinite polar molecular stacks along the c axis, which are laterally packed in a hexagonal fashion. The orientation of the stacks is disordered, but neighboring stacks strongly prefer antiparallel arrangements. Quantitative orientational pair correlation coefficients are determined for all lateral pairs separated by less than 100Å . A careful analysis of the factors influencing the accuracy of the 3D-PDF refinement is presented. It is shown that the effect of statistical errors is small compared to systematic errors coming from diffraction geometry distortions, reciprocal space resolution or incompletely corrected background. Various strategies for identifying and decreasing systematic errors are discussed. The impact of the systematic errors on the uncertainty of the results is not just specific for 3D-ΔPDF investigations but also relevant for other quantitative diffuse scattering modeling techniques.</p>

                  Yell, a program for routine refinement of disorder models against single-crystal diffuse scattering data, is presented. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional delta pair distribution function (3D-ΔPDF) method, which provides direct access to interatomic correlations in real crystal structures. Substitutional, displacive and size-effect disorder models are covered. The input file format supports flexible usage of arithmetic expressions for constraining dependent parameter values. The program is designed to be run on desktop computers. By using an efficient fast-Fourier-transform-based diffuse scattering calculation algorithm, full least-square refinements of medium complexity disorder models may be performed within minutes or hours, even if the experimental diffuse scattering is represented by large and fine-sampled reciprocal space volumes. The program is written in C++ and the source code is distributed under the GPL licence. Binary distributions are currently available for Mac and Windows operating systems.

                  Theory and principles of the three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis of disordered single crystals are introduced. The mathematical framework is presented and the appearance of pair distribution function patterns is discussed on the examples of some basic disorder models. It is further demonstrated how pair distribution function maps are affected by typical experimental problems. Approaches for a better understanding of such effects and strategies for a proper handing of artifacts in diffuse scattering experiments are proposed.
